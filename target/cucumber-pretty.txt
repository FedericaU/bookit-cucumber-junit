    Given user is on the sign-in page                                                      # SignInStepDefinitions.user_is_on_the_sign_in_page()
    Then user logs in as a student with "jhelkin7u@hao123.com" and "stantonmatus" password # SignInStepDefinitions.user_logs_in_as_a_student_with_and_password(String,String)
    Then user navigates to general schedule and verifies subtitle                          # MapStepDefinitions.user_navigates_to_general_schedule_and_verifies_subtitle()
